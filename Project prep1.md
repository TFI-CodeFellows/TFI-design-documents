## Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?

  - Design repo holds wireframes, graphs, and these design docs
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  - We have a git organization that we are all members of.
- What is your Git flow?
  - One ticket on trello should mean one pull request. One pull request is one new branch. You can commit to that branch as many times as you like.
  - We will have a dev branch, this is what we pr to. We merge dev into main to push to production.
- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  - How many people must review a PR?
    - One at least before merge
  - Who merges PRs?
    - Any member of the team, who has looked at the pr
  - How often will you merge?
    - One merge per trello ticket
  - How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
    - If you don't want your pr to be merged yet, set it as a draft. Greyed out prs shouldn't get merged. Reviewers if they want can set a pr to draft after reviewing to get the owner to work on that.
